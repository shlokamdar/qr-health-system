Purpose of this file is to keep track of the next steps for the project.
Every page/section of the project should have a separate point in this file.

1. System Admin now can login from /system/login 
    a. attach the older /system/dashboard to this new login

    c. NEW - add hospitals and create users manually (patient, doctor, lab tech, admin)
    d. NEW - ticketing system for complaints and support
    e. NEW - verify organ donation status and allow/disallow organ donation on card 

2. Patient Registartion Process

       FIX - just keep the preview when registering and an option to go back and edit details before final submission
    b. ADD - Emergency Contact details (name, phone, relationship) + patient's address on the card (maybe back)
    c. Redesign the card to fit all the details
  FIGURE OUT --> take all details at the time of registartion or later on from dashboard as complete your profile.
